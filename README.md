# Rock Paper Scissors Game

### Features:
- Play the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game against the computer.

- Score Tracking:Keeps track of the user's and computer's points throughout the game.
- Exit Option: Allows the user to exit the game at any time, displaying the final scores.

### Installation and Run Instructions:
Clone the repo and run it in any IDE.

### Interesting Parts during the Build Process:
- Implementing the computer’s random choice using Python’s `random.choice()` function was interesting. This function simplifies the process of making the computer's selection truly random and unpredictable, enhancing the gameplay experience.
- Implementing a score-tracking system that updates and displays the user's and computer's points was rewarding. This feature adds a competitive aspect to the game, encouraging players to improve their score against the computer.

### Difficulties Faced and Solutions:
- One challenge was ensuring the user input is valid and handling cases where the input is not recognized. Initially, invalid inputs were not handled correctly, which could confuse players. The solution was to add checks for valid inputs and provide clear feedback when the input was invalid.
- Implementing the exit condition so the game stops gracefully when the user types `exit` was essential. Ensuring that the game ends correctly and displays the final scores required careful handling of the loop and exit conditions.
